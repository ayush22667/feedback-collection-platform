# Feedback Collection Platform - Project Overview

## Executive Summary
A full-stack web application that enables businesses to create customizable feedback forms and collect responses from customers through public URLs. The platform features role-based access with admin capabilities for form creation and response management, while allowing anonymous public submissions.

## Project Goals
1. **Primary**: Build a functional feedback collection system with admin and public interfaces
2. **Secondary**: Demonstrate full-stack development capabilities and best practices
3. **Tertiary**: Create a scalable, maintainable codebase with clear documentation

## Key Features
### Core Features
- **Authentication System**: JWT-based auth for admin users
- **Form Builder**: Dynamic form creation with multiple question types
- **Public Access**: Shareable links for form submission without login
- **Response Management**: View, analyze, and export collected responses
- **Dashboard**: Comprehensive admin interface for form and response management

### Bonus Features
- CSV export functionality
- Mobile-responsive design
- Real-time form analytics

## Technical Stack
### Frontend
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for responsive design
- **State Management**: Context API for authentication
- **Routing**: React Router v6
- **HTTP Client**: Axios
- **Build Tool**: Vite

### Backend
- **Runtime**: Node.js v18+
- **Framework**: Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB with Mongoose ODM
- **Authentication**: JWT with bcrypt
- **Validation**: Joi/Express Validator
- **File Handling**: Multer (if needed)
- **CORS**: Enabled for cross-origin requests

### Development Tools
- **Version Control**: Git
- **Package Manager**: npm/yarn
- **API Testing**: Postman/Thunder Client
- **Code Quality**: ESLint, Prettier
- **Environment**: dotenv for configuration

## User Roles & Permissions
### Admin Users
- Register and login to the platform
- Create, edit, and delete feedback forms
- View all responses to their forms
- Access analytics and summaries
- Export data as CSV
- Generate and share public URLs

### Public Users (Customers)
- Access forms via public URLs
- Submit responses anonymously
- View submission confirmation
- No authentication required

## Security Considerations
1. **Authentication**: JWT tokens with secure httpOnly cookies
2. **Password Storage**: Bcrypt hashing with salt rounds
3. **Input Validation**: Server-side validation for all inputs
4. **CORS Policy**: Restrictive CORS settings
5. **Rate Limiting**: Prevent abuse of public endpoints
6. **Data Sanitization**: Prevent XSS and injection attacks

## Performance Requirements
- Page load time < 3 seconds
- API response time < 500ms for most endpoints
- Support for 100+ concurrent users
- Efficient database queries with indexing

## Scalability Considerations
1. **Database Design**: Normalized schema with proper indexing
2. **API Design**: RESTful principles with pagination
3. **Frontend Architecture**: Component-based with lazy loading
4. **Caching Strategy**: Redis for session management (future)
5. **File Storage**: Cloud storage for large datasets (future)

## Success Metrics
1. **Functionality**: All core features working without critical bugs
2. **Code Quality**: Clean, modular, and well-documented code
3. **User Experience**: Intuitive interface with clear navigation
4. **Performance**: Meeting response time requirements
5. **Documentation**: Comprehensive README and API documentation
